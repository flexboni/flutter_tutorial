# Introduction to widgets

## Basic widgets

### [Text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html)

The **Text** widget let you create a run of styled text within your application

### [Row](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html) &  [Column](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html)

These flex widgets let you create flexible layouts in both the horizontal **(Row)** and vertical **(Column)** directions. The design of these objects is based on the web’s flexbox layout model.

### [Stack](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html)

Instead of being linearly oriented (either horizontally or vertically), a **Stack** widget lets you place widgets on top of each other in paint order. You can then use the Positioned widget on children of a **Stack** to position them relative to the top, right, bottom, or left edge of the stack. Stacks are based on the web’s absolute positioning layout model.

### [Container](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html)

The Container widget lets you create a rectangular visual element. A container can be decorated with a BoxDecoration, such as a background, a border, or a shadow. A Container can also have margins, padding, and constraints applied to its size. In addition, a Container can be transformed in three dimensional space using a matrix.

### For example

Below are some simple widgets that combine these and other widgets:
