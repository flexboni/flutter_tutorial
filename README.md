# flutter_tutorial

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Note

- you’ll want to use Flutter’s “profile” or “release” build modes. For more details, see [Flutter’s build modes](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/build-modes)
- Important: If you’re concerned about the package size of your app, see [Measuring your app’s size](https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/app-size)
- This codelab is part 1 of a two-part codelab. You can find part 2 on [Google Developers Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/#0) (as well as a copy of this codelab, part 1).
